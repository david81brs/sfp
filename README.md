Do we really need another functional lib for Python? The answer is no. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ We have awesome alternatives such as (x, y, z) .
The idea of this lib is to be a 'minimal version' of functional features which we like to use on our projects (ex: pipe, compose, zipwith, head, tail) without complex requirements. They are meant to be simple functions, written in pure Python that can be really helpful for your projects.
